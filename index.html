Has there ever been a time when you felt like a square peg in a round hole? Do you ever wonder if there's more to life than just going through the motions? We hear you. Sometimes, it feels like society wants clones, not individuals. 
</p>

<h2>But here's the thing</h2>

<p>
It doesn't have to be that way. The Community Den is a place where you can be your most authentic self, without fear of judgment or ridicule. Someimes when you get real with others about your own mental health stimgass how up. We don't do judgment around here. This is a compassionate community, not just for some — but for all, and you can help us spread the awareness just by continuing to read this messsage. 

<h2>Reading on is like giving your teddy bear a warm hug — it just feels right.</h2>

After discovering the Three Core Principles, you'll go on to find the Teddy Bear's special care instructions. These two short projects are just the beginning of a roadmap aimed closer towards demanding that your life be a happier, healthier, and more fulfilling experience.
</p>

<h2>Where's Your Teddy?</h2>

<p>
See, when you take care of a Teddy, you're really taking care of yourself. And we believe that when you take care of yourself, you're also taking care of the community. THAT'S why we're so passionate about what we do! We've seen firsthand the negative impact that countercultural movements can have on mental well-being. 

So let's talk about how the core principles, and taking care of your Teddy, can help you be your most authentic self, and also make TB4BA a better community.

<h2>TB4BA Priniciple One - Unleash your inner Teddy Bear: pay attention to yourself</h2>
We all get caught up in the hustle and bustle of life, but we gotta remember to make time everyday to do exercises that strengthen mental health. Who else is going to do that for us? Whether it's taking a 60-second break to quiet our minds at work, or prioritizing self-care instead of a weekend full of commitments — even small efforts can make a big difference. Look, at the end of the day YOU are the ONLY one that can take charge of this mental health journey. Think about it — of all the BILLIONS of people on this planet, it's only you that knows the real deal. It is YOU that knows yourself best. So take the time to check in with yourself regularly, and take the opportunity sometimes to just treat yourself like you would treat a teddy bear that you love - because when you do that, it benefits us all!

<h2>TB4BA Priniciple Two - Talk it out (even with the grizzlies)</h2>
Talking to others is key to maintaining good mental health. Studies show that having people around us who support us, like good friends, can help protect us from anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress. By connecting with others, we can share our experiences and get support from those who might be going through similar problems. Sometimes, having a supportive community can make all the difference in getting through the day.

And just to be real, we know that things can't always be rainbows and gumdrops all the time! So, when it comes to mental health, it's both — support AND honesty — that we really need everyday; even though dealing with unresolved emotions, difficult people or annoying situations can be tough, and not all conflicts are healthy. It's important to put your mental health first and set boundaries. Communicate honestly and have tough conversations, while also being kind and gentle with yourself. Just like friends and Teddy Bears who help us through hard times, you should be the first person to make an attempt to take care of yourself sometimes.
